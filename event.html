						<h2>Call for proposals</h2>
						<p class="lead">In the years before his sudden death in April 2020, he has become increasingly interested in wowology and wonderology: on the incredible in its positive sense, the remarkable, the memorable, the unique and the unforgettable. It is the science of making us aware of the exceptional, the remarkable, the inimitable, all that Mary Poppins would have described as Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. It is in this spirit that we look for contributions in the following tracks and formats.</p>

                        <p class="lead">There are two tracks and two formats for which you can submit your contributions. All contributors are contacted personally by the organiser to discuss their contributions. The selection is based on the quality and originality of the proposal and on how much it contributes to the goal of the conference.</p>

                                Contributions for this track should give the audience an insight into what person Kim Veltman was. Anecdotal or episodic story blips can help to bring forth the character traits that guide this man's life and help those who are interested in his work put it into a more sympathetic perspective. To understand what motivated him, inspired him or what he was up against personally is valuable for those out there interested in his professional work. This is the fun track that is there to create the empathy so often lacking from the cold academic tint inscripted to intellectuals of his statue.                            </div>

                            Contributions for this track have the herculean task to pick and focus on any of his published books or articles and pontificate on it. We look for experts who were either collaborators of a given book or article or are themselves experts in that particular field of study Kim’s work is about. Contributions for this track are explicitly asked to stick to the common academic format and practices since they will address an academic audience. We look specifically for people who can cover his major published works.

						<h2>Travel tips</h2>
						<p class="lead">Maastricht is located in the southernmost part of the Netherlands, about 25 km from Liège (Belgium) and 30 km from Aachen (Germany). The Maastricht University Office’s Aula is located in the city centre at Minderbroedersstraat 4. The city of Maastricht has been transformed in recent years. The former ceramics industry has reduced considerably, and the city now hosts a lively creative arts industry. It is perhaps the oldest city in the Netherlands, dating back over 2000 years, and it became a major religious centre in the middle ages. The inner city is renowned for its former monasteries and convents remain, many of which now house faculties and institutes of the university.

                                Maastricht is easily accessible by plane, air or even bus. Here you will find more information about how to get to Maastricht. 
                            </p>

                                <p><b>Train</b></p>
                                <p>Maastricht is easily accessible by train from Amsterdam, Aachen (Germany) and Liège (Belgium). High-speed trains connect Liège and Aachen rapidly with Cologne, Brussels and Paris, among others. </p>
                                
                                <p><b>Air</b></p>
                                <p>Participants arriving by air may choose to use Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, Eindhoven Airport, or Brussels Zaventem Airport. All three airports have smooth transport links with Maastricht. Travel from Amsterdam Schiphol takes about 2½ hours, Eindhoven about 1½ hours, and Brussels Zaventem about 2 hours, depending on transport connections.
                                Other nearby airports include Cologne-Bonn and Düsseldorf, although onward transport is more complex. Both Liège and Maastricht also have airports, but these are mainly used for holiday travel.
                                </p> 
                                <p><b>Bus/Flixbus</b></p>
                                <p>
                                    Long distance buses (Flixbus) connect Maastricht to some 90 destinations. The international bus terminal is on the far side (east) of the rail station (Meerssenerweg 378). More in formation about Flixbus can be found here.
                                    The city bus service (Arriva) runs regular services connecting all parts throughout the day and evening. One service (350) connects Maastricht with Aachen every 15 minutes. Note: Buses arrive at and leave from the same stop in front of Aachen station slightly to your left. Buses go first to Aachen Centrum (busstation/bushof) before returning to Maastricht via a different route.
                                    There are also Belgian services connecting Maastricht with Hasselt, Tongeren and Liège.

                                MECC Hotel Services is the official provider of hotel accommodation for the Conference. They have reserved options at a number of centrally located hotels and hostels.
