						<h2>Travel tips</h2>
						<p class="lead">Maastricht is located in the southernmost part of the Netherlands, about 25 km from Liège (Belgium) and 30 km from Aachen (Germany). The Maastricht University Office’s Aula is located in the city centre at Minderbroedersstraat 4. The city of Maastricht has been transformed in recent years. The former ceramics industry has reduced considerably, and the city now hosts a lively creative arts industry. It is perhaps the oldest city in the Netherlands, dating back over 2000 years, and it became a major religious centre in the middle ages. The inner city is renowned for its former monasteries and convents remain, many of which now house faculties and institutes of the university.

                                Maastricht is easily accessible by plane, air or even bus. Here you will find more information about how to get to Maastricht. 
                            </p>

                                <p><b>Train</b></p>
                                <p>Maastricht is easily accessible by train from Amsterdam, Aachen (Germany) and Liège (Belgium). High-speed trains connect Liège and Aachen rapidly with Cologne, Brussels and Paris, among others. </p>
                                
                                <p><b>Air</b></p>
                                <p>Participants arriving by air may choose to use Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, Eindhoven Airport, or Brussels Zaventem Airport. All three airports have smooth transport links with Maastricht. Travel from Amsterdam Schiphol takes about 2½ hours, Eindhoven about 1½ hours, and Brussels Zaventem about 2 hours, depending on transport connections.
                                Other nearby airports include Cologne-Bonn and Düsseldorf, although onward transport is more complex. Both Liège and Maastricht also have airports, but these are mainly used for holiday travel.
                                </p> 
                                <p><b>Bus/Flixbus</b></p>
                                <p>
                                    Long distance buses (Flixbus) connect Maastricht to some 90 destinations. The international bus terminal is on the far side (east) of the rail station (Meerssenerweg 378). More in formation about Flixbus can be found here.
                                    The city bus service (Arriva) runs regular services connecting all parts throughout the day and evening. One service (350) connects Maastricht with Aachen every 15 minutes. Note: Buses arrive at and leave from the same stop in front of Aachen station slightly to your left. Buses go first to Aachen Centrum (busstation/bushof) before returning to Maastricht via a different route.
                                    There are also Belgian services connecting Maastricht with Hasselt, Tongeren and Liège.

                                MECC Hotel Services is the official provider of hotel accommodation for the Conference. They have reserved options at a number of centrally located hotels and hostels.
