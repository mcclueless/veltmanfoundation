                        <h2>Tracks and formats</h2>
                        <p class="lead">There are two tracks and two formats for which you can submit your contributions. All contributors are contacted personally by the organiser to discuss their contributions. The selection is based on the quality and originality of the proposal and on how much it contributes to the goal of the conference.</p>
						<h5>Track 1: Kim Veltman Life: Scholar, explorer, believer</h5>
                        <p class="mb-lg-0">Contributions for this track should give the audience an insight into what person Kim Veltman was. Anecdotal or episodic story blips can help to bring forth the character traits that guide this man's life and help those who are interested in his work put it into a more sympathetic perspective. To understand what motivated him, inspired him or what he was up against personally is valuable for those out there interested in his professional work. This is the fun track that is there to create the empathy so often lacking from the cold academic tint inscripted to intellectuals of his statue. </p><br>
						<h5>Track 2: Kim Veltman’s Work: From his early works of Leonardo to his last work on the history of Alphabets</h5>
						<p class="mb-lg-0">Contributions for this track have the herculean task to pick and focus on any of his published books or articles and pontificate on it. We look for experts who were either collaborators of a given book or article or are themselves experts in that particular field of study Kim’s work is about. Contributions for this track are explicitly asked to stick to the common academic format and practices since they will address an academic audience. We look specifically for people who can cover his main works: </p>
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">Linear Perspective and the Visual Dimension of Science and Art, 1986</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Leonardo da Vinci Studies, 1993</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Frontiers in Conceptual navigation for Cultural heritage, 1999</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Understanding New Media: Augmented Knowledge and Culture, 2006</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">9 and 11, 2014</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Sources and Literature of Perspective: Volume 1&2: Sources of Perspective, 2020</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						  <p class="mb-lg-0">Besides the two tracks contributors are asked for submission for two different formats:</p><br>
						  <h5>Keynotes</h5>
						  <p class="mb-lg-0">Keynotes are typically 90 minutes duration with 45 minutes of presentations followed by a Q&A. Keynotes are held either online or on location in Maastricht and streamed live. </p>
						  <h5>Oral presentations</h5>
						  <p class="mb-lg-0">Oral presentations will typically be scheduled in thematic sessions of 90 minutes comprising three presentations, with 30 minutes (20min. for presentation + 10min. for discussion) allocated to each individual presentation.</p>
